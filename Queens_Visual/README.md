CISC 481: Artificial Intelligence 
Program 2: N Queens

Visual Representation of Backtracking with Minimum Remaining Values and CSP

Assignment Objectives:
After completing this assignment, you’ll understand the inner workings of the following search algorithms:
    • AC-3 and Maintaining Arc Consistency
    • Backtracking Search for CSPs
    
You’ll also gain some experience setting up a basic web service to visualize the results of your
backtracking search.

The n-Queens Problem:
    Another classic problem studied in Artificial Intelligence, the goal is to place queens on a chess board such that no pair of queens threaten one another. The standard instance is the 8-queens problem, where you need to place 8 queens on a standard (8×8) chess board. In this assignment, you’ll want your code to be able to solve up to 32-queens (that is, place 32 queens on a 32 × 32 board).

Comments:
    Make the 'n' or number of queens how ever large you want. For small values you cannot see the visualization but can moderate the speed using the radio buttons. After watching the netflix series 'Queens Gambit', I thought it would be approriate in naming the program after it.
